# hello-world

No one knows any magic tricks how to skip the hard work.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Everything is a thought.

Reality is a hallucination created out of our perception and the way of how we look at things. You - yourself create your reality.

We are on this green - blue round spaceship, no one understands what is happening around them, they just pretend to have everything under control, you are not alone. Drop the act, embrace that you don't know anything and then you will.

Have a good day.
